> What part of the design did you get stuck on? What took the most time? Similarly, what was the easiest part? 

I've never used MUI and React before, but I've thought that it's a good opportunity to try it now, so I researched how to work with React and MUI library. And it took me most of the time. 

> What part of the design didn't make sense? Did you change anything?

I think that big margins that separate links are not necessary for the left-hand drawer, maybe they had to be smaller, or maybe instead of margins it is better to use section headings

> If you had more time, what would you have liked to implement? 

> What did you have to research or lookup while working on this? 

As I mentioned before I've never worked with React and any React library, so I spent a day researching, and another day doing the task.
