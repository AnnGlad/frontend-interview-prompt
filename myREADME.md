- [x]  Are the margins and padding similar to the image? Were the colors close? 

As close as possible (given image had non-standard size), so I seized it down to 1920px width

- [x] Were clickable items accounted for with the right elements? e.g. (was a button or dropdown element used where it should have been used)

Yes

- [x]  How was the project set up? 

I used Material UI library that you have suggested. 

- [x]  If deviations to the design were made, were they justified? 

I tried to stick up to design, but I have made some minor changes to make all similar blocks look the same.

## Questions To Answer: 
- Please share your screen resolution, OS, browser version (best if you're using latest) you used to test in so we can look at it in: 

1920 x 1080, Windows 10, Chrome 79.0.3945.117

- What part of the design did you get stuck on? What took the most time? Similarly, what was the easiest part? 

I've never used MUI and React before, but I've thought that it's a good opportunity to try it now, so I researched how to work with React and MUI library. And it took me most of the time. 

- What part of the design didn't make sense? Did you change anything?

I think that big margins that separate links are not necessary for the left-hand drawer, maybe they had to be smaller, or maybe instead of margins it is better to use section headings

- If you had more time, what would you have liked to implement? 

- What did you have to research or lookup while working on this? 

As I mentioned before I've never worked with React and any React library, so I spend a day just fo researching, and another day for task.
